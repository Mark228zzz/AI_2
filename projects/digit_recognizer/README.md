# Digit recognier

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## **Download and install MNIST dataset**
   When you run the script, **the MNIST dataset will be automatically downloaded** and stored in the project directory. **Please ensure you have sufficient disk space** as this will download multiple files related to the MNIST dataset.

## Key Points:
- **Warning About MNIST Data**: The README explicitly mentions that running the script will download the MNIST dataset and advises users to ensure they have sufficient disk space.
- **Simple Setup Instructions**: It provides clear instructions on how to set up the environment and run the project.
- **Resource-Intensive**: This project can be **resource-intensive**. It is recommended to use a GPU for faster training. Running this on a weak CPU may cause significant lag or slow down your system.
